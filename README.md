# Home-Lab


## Objective


The objective of the Home Lab Project is to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus is to set up virtual machines (such as Kali Linux and Ubuntu) to create an isolated environment where I can practice cybersecurity techniques, conduct experiments, and deepen my understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies

### Skills Learned


- Network Security: Understanding and securing network architectures.
- Threat Detection: Identifying and analyzing potential cyber threats.
- Incident Response: Developing procedures to respond to security incidents.
- Digital Forensics: Investigating and analyzing digital evidence.
- Log Analysis: Interpreting log data to uncover suspicious activities.
- Vulnerability Assessment: Identifying and mitigating system vulnerabilities.
- Penetration Testing: Simulating cyberattacks to find security weaknesses.
- Using Security Tools: Proficiency with tools like Wireshark, Metasploit, and Splunk.
- SIEM: Implementing and using Security Information and Event Management systems.
- Documentation: Creating detailed reports and documenting incidents effectively.

### Tools Used


- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
